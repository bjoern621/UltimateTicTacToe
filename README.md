  A game of Ultimate Tic-Tac-ToeA game of Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe versus my AI
  A remake of a personal project I originally wrote for my site in 9th grade, Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe is a variant of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe with a drastically expanded rule set that allows for significantly more strategy (see here for rules). My remake is responsive to many more screen sizes, improves the multiplayer   experience, and introduces an AI to play against in single player.

  The online multiplayer offers real-time multiplayer between two clients on different machines using Socket.IO. Communication between devices is handled by a Socket.IO Node server I'm running on a free Azure instance.

  The AI is powered by a Monte-Carlo Tree Search. On hard, the algorithm runs for 5 seconds (one on medium), so difficulty depends on the machine you play on. I managed to beat the AI on my phone once; so far, no luck on my laptop."
